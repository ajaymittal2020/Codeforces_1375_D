You're given an array of n integers between 0 and n inclusive.

In one operation, you can choose any element of the array and replace it by the MEX of the elements of the array (which may change after the operation).

For example, if the current array is [0,2,2,1,4], you can choose the second element and replace it by the MEX of the present elements  â€” 3. Array will become [0,3,2,1,4].

You must make the array non-decreasing, using at most 2n operations.

It can be proven that it is always possible. Please note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations. If there are many solutions, you can print any of them.
